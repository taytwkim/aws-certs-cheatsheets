# AWS Certifications Cheatsheets

Over the summer I passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) and Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) exams.

To prepare, I made my own cheatsheets to cram before the tests. They’re not a replacement for a full course or a study guide, but they’re something you can print out, carry around, and review on the go.

For now, I’m sharing the CLF-C02 cheatsheet. Since CLF-C02 only requires high-level knowledge, I’ve kept it to one-liners with exam keywords, enough to refresh your memory before test day.

I also have a longer SAA-C03 version with more detail and architectural diagrams. If anyone finds this CLF-C02 cheatsheet useful, I’ll polish that one up and release it as well.

Credit to Stéphane Maarek and his AWS courses on Udemy — these cheatsheets are essentially condensed from his slides, with my own explanations mixed in.
